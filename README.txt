This mod adds a machine that gives random benefits, among them are the base drinks of each map and 
extras like PHD or ammo regeneration. 
This mod is made to work with the bonus survival 3.0 maps but just change the devars to work with the base maps.

Bugs I have found:
*The base perk machines are locked (you can still get the perks with the machine the mod adds).
*The mule kik doesn't work (can be fixed by opting for the one given by the machine).
*It can cause conflict with other mods, it has only happened to me with zombies++ but it is solved by deactivating the machines that it adds from the dedicated_zm.cfg.

This is just a version that I made in my spare time so it will have some other bugs.

I hope you find it useful :)
